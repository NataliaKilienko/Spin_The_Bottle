# Spin The Bottle

**Spin The Bottle** is a fun web-based game where players enter their names, and the bottle "spins" to randomly select one of the participants. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive and visually engaging experience.

## Features

- **Player Addition:** Users can enter player names using a form input and add them to the list of players dynamically without page reload.
- **Spin Button:** A spin button simulates the spinning of the bottle, selecting a random player after a short delay.
- **Status Updates:** The application provides status updates, such as when players are added, and which player is selected.
- **Duplicate Check:** Ensures that player names cannot be added twice.
- **Form Validation:** Checks for empty input fields and provides feedback.

## How to Play

1. Enter a player name in the input field.
2. Click the **"Add player"** button to add them to the list.
3. Once all players are added, click the **"Spin"** button.
4. The game will display the name of the randomly selected player.
